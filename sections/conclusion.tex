\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of 3D face authentication systems with a single photo and find the key is to bypass its 3D liveness detection module.
% Meanwhile, we find a carefully designed scatter pattern can spoof the structured light depth camera to capture forgery depth information. 
Therefore, we propose the \texttt{DepthFake} attack, which estimates the depth information from a single photo, modulates it to a structured light scatter pattern, and projects such a scatter pattern  on the adversarial photo of a legitimate user to spoof the 3D face authentication system.
Evaluation with three commercial face authentication systems (Tencent Cloud, Baidu Cloud, and 3DiVi) and one commercial access control device demonstrates the effectiveness of \texttt{DepthFake}  attacks in the real world. In addition to the face authentication system analyzed in this paper, our work can be extended to other systems equipped with structured light depth cameras. Future directions include exploring the security of the full workflow of face authentication and the security of other depth systems.
